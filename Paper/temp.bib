@article{Gerkey2008,
abstract = {We consider the problem of autonomous naviga- tion in an unstructured outdoor environment. We describe the planning and control aspects of an implemented system that drives a robot at modest speeds (1 m/s) over a variety of outdoor terrain. In real time, we use a gradient technique to plan globally optimal paths on a cost map, then employ a predictive dynamic controller to compute local velocity commands. Our planner and controller are considered the best in class among 10 teams competing in the DARPA Learning Applied to Ground Robotics (LAGR) program.},
