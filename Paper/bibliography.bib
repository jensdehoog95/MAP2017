abstract = {For many applications in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) scenarios robots need to learn a map of unknown environments. We present a system for fast online learning of occupancy grid maps requiring low computational resources. It combines a robust scan matching approach using a LIDAR system with a 3D attitude estimation system based on inertial sensing. By using a fast approximation of map gradients and a multi-resolution grid, reliable localization and mapping capabilities in a variety of challenging environments are realized. Multiple datasets showing the applicability in an embedded hand-held mapping system are provided. We show that the system is sufficiently accurate as to not require explicit loop closing techniques in the considered scenarios. The software is available as an open source package for ROS.},

@article{King-Hele2002,
	abstract = {Carriage journeys in England during the eighteenth century were notoriously dangerous. Rutted and pot-holed roads exacerbated the deficiencies in steering, springing and stability. In 1758 the young Dr Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802; F.R.S. 1761) was travelling about 10 000 miles a year in visits to patients from his house at Lichfield. To alleviate the danger and discomfort of his journey, he developed a design for improved carriage steering and stability, which he road-tested over 20 000 miles on two carriages. In 1765 Richard Lovell Edgeworth (1744-1817; F.R.S. 1781) heard about Darwin's design, urged the Society of Arts to enquire about it, and then visited Darwin himself. With the aid of manuscripts from the Archive of the Royal Society of Arts and elsewhere, I offer a reconstruction of Darwin's improved method of steering, which relies on four jointed rods, initially in the form of an isosceles trapezium. The mechanism was reinvented more than 50 years later, and came to be used widely in early modern cars.},

The present experiments investigate if it is feasible to present the navigation information on a tactile display. Important design issue of the display is how direction and distance information must be coded. Important usability issues are the resolution of the display and its usefulness in vibrating environments. In a pilot study with 12 pedestrians, different distance-coding schemes were compared. The schemes translated distance to vibration rhythm while the direction was translated into vibration location. The display consisted of eight tactors around the user's waist. The results show that mapping waypoint direction on the location of vibration is an effective coding scheme that requires no training, but that coding for distance does not improve performance compared to a control condition with no distance information. In Experiment 2, the usefulness of the tactile display was shown in two case studies with a helicopter and a fast boat.},

Wayfinding, i.e. getting from some origin to a destination, is one of Current in-vehicle navigation systems place an emphasis on the use of distances within their turn-by-turn directions (e.g. left turn in 300 metres). Previous work has shown the potential for landmarks (e.g. traffic lights, churches), particularly in relation to subjective aspects of system usability, e.g. confidence in navigating. To test the objective benefits of landmarks versus distances, road-based trials were conducted in which 28 participants drove unfamiliar routes within an urban area using a simulated navigation system (turn-by-turn directions on both a display and voice) that emphasised either landmarks or distances for the purposes of locating manoeuvres. When using the landmark system, relatively few glances were made towards the navigation display and workload was perceived to be lower, in comparison with the figures attained for the distance system. Furthermore, the duration of glances towards the landmark display were low. Nevertheless, participants made some navigational errors when using landmarks. The results are discussed in relation to the design of future ‘landmark-oriented' navigation systems.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of landmark information of varying quality within drivers' navigation instructions on driving and navigation performance when navigating an unfamiliar route. Background: Current vehicle navigation systems predominantly use distance-to-turn information to enable a driver to locate a forthcoming maneuver. Although it has been proposed that the design of driver navigation aids can be improved through the incorporation of landmarks as key navigation cues, little research has investigated how the quality of the landmark affects driver behavior. Method: An empirical field trial in a real traffic environment was undertaken with 48 participants in order to assess the effect of landmark quality on driver behavior when navigating an unfamiliar, complex, urban route. Results: The use of good landmarks (as opposed to poor landmarks or distance information) as key verbal navigation cues resulted in significant improvements in navigation performance, driving performance, and driver confidence immediately preceding a turn. The use of distance information to locate a turn resulted in significantly more glances to the in-vehicle display. Conclusions: Good landmarks offer significant safety and performance benefits to a driver navigating an unfamiliar route. Poor landmarks can result in driver performance worse than that obtained using distance to turn to locate forthcoming maneuvers. Application: The design of future vehicle navigation systems should not rely on distance-to turn information alone to enable a driver to locate forthcoming maneuvers but, rather, should incorporate good landmarks within the navigation instructions they present to drivers.

Common mobile robot which employs line tracking system can only work on pre-constructed track where else infrared guided robot only can work within infrared's line of sight. In addition to that, the wheel driving system of the mobile robot plays a vital role in allowing the robot to navigate along a limited direction depending on its wheel architecture. To steer a robot in any direction and to know its precise location in the environment is the ultimate goal of mobile robot navigation. To achieve this, a methodology is laid out in this paper. An Optical Tracking Device (OTD) module is utilized to provide the accurate coordinates of the current location of the robot virtually on many flat surfaces. A holonomic wheel system is designed to allow the robot to navigate through multiple destinations. A navigation algorithm is developed to position the robot to any point accurately on a flat surface. This will allow the robot to freely move in any direction to reach multiple target destinations without any difficulties.},

	abstract = {In this paper, differential steering control with proportional controller method are developed. In the steering control of mobile robot, the underlying dynamics of processes are often highly complex due to operating problems such as actuator constrains, time delay and disturbances. Because of these reasons, many control system of mobile robots require extensive retuning the control parameter and the worst cases may result in redesigning or change the control program and hardware. To solve the above mentioned problems, we use proportional control method. Based on the model proportional control method, we predict the path that the mobile robot will follow by using the current velocities of the right wheel and the left wheel which update the real-time current position of mobile robot. The model proportional method is to overcome time delay cause by slow response of the sensor and other dynamic processes. The outputs from the control are the velocity and angular velocity of mobile robot. From these velocity and angular velocity of mobile robot we determine the number of encoder pulses for the right wheel and left wheel. The number of encoder pulses for the right wheel and left wheel are input to the right DC motor and to the left DC motor of mobile robot to generate the velocity of each wheel. The proportional controller is used to produce the same speed of the right wheel and the left wheel in order to make the mobile robot move in a straight line. It also used to produce the desired speed of the right wheel and left wheel for steering control to make left or right turning.},

This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation. This drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out resampling operations, which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with real mobile robots in large-scale indoor, as well as outdoor, environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches},
